# Bombo Legüero - Finger Perc

Screen recording of app: 

![](gifOfDemo.gif)

This app is a playable musical instrument. It is packaged with a set of ±150 audio samples
(expandable) which are individually triggered when a user touches various zones on the screen. 
Those samples are recordings of Bombo Legüero, a traditional Andean folk music drum typically made of 
wood and alpaca skins or cowhide. 

There are two zones on the screen which represent the primary sounds that the instrument can make:
a hit on the wooden rim of the drum and a hit in the center of the drum head. 
Each of those two zones has many subzones, generated automatically based on the provided sample set. 
At present, there are 10 sub-zones for the rim articulation, and 12 for the head articulation. 
Each sub-zone corresponds to a different volume for that articulation. 
That is the deepest level of detail that the user can control, however, there is another 
layer of depth to the sample set. Each volume of each articulations is accompanied by a set 
(between 5-10 audio files) of repetitions of the same sound. Those samples are called 
"Round Robins" and are intended to add human imperfections to repeated notes, thus avoiding the
dreaded "machine gun effect". 

Coming to the play store soon.
